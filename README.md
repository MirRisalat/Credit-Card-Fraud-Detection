# Credit Card Fraud Detection using Random Forest

## Overview

This GitHub repository contains a Credit Card Fraud Detection project implemented using the Random Forest machine learning algorithm. Credit card fraud is a significant concern for both financial institutions and cardholders. Detecting fraudulent transactions is crucial to prevent financial losses and maintain the trust of customers.

This project aims to create a robust and accurate fraud detection system by training a Random Forest classifier on a labeled dataset of credit card transactions. The Random Forest algorithm is chosen for its ability to handle imbalanced datasets and provide reliable predictions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.x installed
- Virtual environment (optional but recommended)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MirRisalat/Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
   ```

3. Install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Data

The dataset used for this project contains credit card transaction data. It is not included in this repository due to its size and sensitivity. You can obtain the dataset from a trusted source and place it in the `data.csv/` directory. Make sure to update the data loading code in the project accordingly.

## Usage

To run the credit card fraud detection system, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your dataset as mentioned in the Data section.

2. Train the Random Forest model by running the training script:

   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

3. Once the model is trained, you can make predictions on new data using the inference script:

   ```bash
   python predict.py
   ```

## Model Training

The model training process involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, and training the Random Forest classifier. The trained model is then saved for future use in fraud detection.

## Evaluation

We evaluate the model's performance using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC. The evaluation results are presented in the `evaluation/` directory.

## Results

The project aims to achieve a high level of accuracy in detecting fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives. Detailed results and visualizations can be found in the `results/` directory.


## Acknowledgments

We would like to acknowledge the creators of the dataset used in this project and the open-source community for their valuable contributions to the field of machine learning and fraud detection.
