# Credit Card Fraud Detection using Random Forest

### Project Overview:

**Objective:** The objective of the project is to build a model that can accurately identify fraudulent credit card transactions to minimize financial losses for both the credit card company and its customers.

**Tools and Technologies:**
1. Programming Language: Python
2. Libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
3. Dataset: A labeled dataset with historical credit card transactions, where each transaction is marked as either fraudulent or non-fraudulent.

### Project Steps:

1. **Data Collection:**

   Obtain a credit card transaction dataset with features such as transaction amount, timestamp, and anonymized features related to the transaction. You can source this data from financial institutions, data repositories, or generate synthetic data. Here, we have used a dataset from Keggle.com which is uploaded in the "dataset/" file.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**

   Clean the data by addressing missing values, duplicates, and outliers. Standardize or normalize features like transaction amount and timestamp. Since credit card fraud datasets are usually imbalanced (fraudulent transactions are rare), perform resampling techniques such as oversampling (adding more fraudulent transactions) or undersampling (reducing non-fraudulent transactions) to balance the dataset. in this case, we have used SMOTE feature for standardization.

3. **Feature Engineering:**

   Create new features or transform existing ones that might improve model performance. For example, you could generate time-based features from the timestamp, such as day of the week, hour of the day, etc.

4. **Data Splitting:**

   Divide the dataset into training and testing sets. Typically, you would use a significant portion for training (e.g., 70-80%) and the rest for testing the model's performance.

5. **Model Selection:**

   Choose Random Forest as the machine learning algorithm for this project. Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to make predictions.

6. **Model Training:**

   Train the Random Forest model on the training dataset. Ensure that the model can handle imbalanced data by adjusting hyperparameters, such as class weights or using resampling techniques.

7. **Model Evaluation:**

   Evaluate the model's performance using metrics suitable for imbalanced datasets, including:
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Precision, Recall (Sensitivity), F1-Score

   Tweak the model hyperparameters and explore feature importance to improve performance. Cross-validation can help assess the model's stability and generalization.

8. **Model Testing:**

   Use the trained model to make predictions on the test dataset. Assess its performance by comparing the model's predictions to the actual fraudulent transactions in the test set.

9. **Post-processing and Threshold Tuning:**

   Depending on the business requirements, you may need to adjust the classification threshold to optimize the model's behavior in terms of precision and recall.

10. **Deployment:**

    If the model performs well, deploy it in a real-time or batch processing system that can analyze incoming credit card transactions for potential fraud.

11. **Monitoring and Maintenance:**

    Continuously monitor the model's performance and retrain it periodically as new data becomes available or if its performance degrades over time.

12. **Documentation and Reporting:**

    Document the entire project, including data preprocessing steps, model selection, hyperparameters, evaluation metrics, and deployment process. Provide clear and concise reports to stakeholders and management.

Remember that credit card fraud detection is a critical application, and the model should be regularly updated to adapt to evolving fraud patterns and stay effective in protecting against fraudulent transactions.
